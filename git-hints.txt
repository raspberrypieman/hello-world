This is a small list of useful git commands

To start a fresh local copy of a project residing in github repository 
	git clone https://github.com/raspberrypieman/hello-world.git

Or if you already have the project cloned but want the latest version
	git pull <filename>

To add a new file
	git add <newfilename>

Make any changes you need to files in local directory, then check status
	git status

When you need to upload changes, first use commit (-a for all files)
	git commit -a -m "Helpful comments about changes"

Then to make permanent changes to branch
	git push origin master

To get a list of changes (use 'q' to exit the list)
	git log
